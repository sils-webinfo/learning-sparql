# Learning SPARQL

To download the examples and install `arq`:

```sh
make install
```

Then, you should be able to run a query as shown on page 5 of *Learning SPARQL*.

```sh
arq --data ex002.ttl --query ex003.rq
```

Note that every example in *Learning SPARQL* has a filename specified
as a comment at the top, like this:

```rq
# filename: ex008.rq
```
